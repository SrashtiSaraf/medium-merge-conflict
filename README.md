# What is this about?

This is a repository for demonstrating merge conflicts - to support my [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@RedRoxProjects).

* Second we cover using the command line and how to handle merge conflicts between local and remote repositories. :sparkles:

* Third we will take a quick look at merging using the GitHub Desktop Application :+1:
